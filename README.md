# Bus Stop Tracker
## A simple program that uses mapbox to plot the bus stops from MIT to Harvard using markers.

How to Run: Click on the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button to run the program.

Roadmap: Have the animation loop back and forth. Create a feature to let the user be able to see more details about each bus stop such as times etc.
